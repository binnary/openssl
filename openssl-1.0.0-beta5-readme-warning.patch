+ WARNING
+ -------
+
+ This version of OpenSSL is built in a way that supports operation in
+ the so called FIPS mode. Note though that the library as we build it
+ is not FIPS validated and the FIPS mode is present for testing purposes
+ only.
+ 
+ This version also contains a few differences from the upstream code
+ some of which are:
+   * There are added changes forward ported from the upstream OpenSSL
+     0.9.8 FIPS branch however the FIPS integrity verification check
+     is implemented differently from the upstream FIPS validated OpenSSL
+     module. It verifies HMAC-SHA256 checksum of the whole shared
+     libraries. For this reason the changes are ported to files in the
+     crypto directory and not in a separate fips subdirectory. Also
+     note that the FIPS integrity verification check requires unmodified
+     libcrypto and libssl shared library files which means that it will
+     fail if these files are modified for example by prelink.
+   * The module respects the kernel FIPS flag /proc/sys/crypto/fips and
+     tries to initialize the FIPS mode if it is set to 1 aborting if the
+     FIPS mode could not be initialized. It is also possible to force the
+     OpenSSL library to FIPS mode especially for debugging purposes by
+     setting the environment variable OPENSSL_FORCE_FIPS_MODE.
+   * If the environment variable OPENSSL_NO_DEFAULT_ZLIB is set the module
+     will not automatically load the built in compression method ZLIB
+     when initialized. Applications can still explicitely ask for ZLIB
+     compression method.
